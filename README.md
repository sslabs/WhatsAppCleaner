Tired of WhatsApp daily backing-up its databases, consumming your priceless internal storage and forcing yout to peridically delete those back-up files?
Your problems are over.

Whatsapp Cleaner claims to dailly delete the WhatsApp's back-up files. You just have to schedule a time to cleanup runs.

And don't worry, Whatapp Cleaner only deletes the back-ups, you messages will still be there.

Make sure to grant storage permission when asked for. In adiction, some devices limit auto starts to applications after device boots so you also should allow the Whatsapp Cleaner to auto starts after device boots.

Use it at you own risk. The kid behind this won't be responsible for any data loss.
